## âœ¨ Features 

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Detects blur, lighting issues, facial clarity, and background distractions.  
- **Multi-Format Support**: Accepts `.png` and `.jpeg` files.  
- **Serverless Architecture**: Scalable and cost-efficient with API Gateway, Lambda, and Rekognition.  
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Fully deployed using Terraform.
